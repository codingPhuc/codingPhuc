**Amazon Lex Bot**  is a fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) service with advanced natural language models to design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces in applications.

**Amazon Lex Bot have the following used case**:

- Build virtual agents and voice assistants: Enable self-service capabilities with virtual contact center agents and interactive voice response (IVR). Users can change a password or schedule an appointment without speaking to a human agent.

- Improve productivity with application bots : Automate basic user tasks in your application with powerful chatbots. Seamlessly connect with other enterprise software through AWS Lambda and maintain granular access control through IAM.
- Maximize the information trapped in transcripts : Design chatbots using existing contact center transcripts. Reduce design time from weeks to hours and accelerate bot deployment.

today we will be using Amazon lex bot to create a Atomization process for collecting and storing  employees data into the databases
